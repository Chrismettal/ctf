This is a playground of me playing CTF's.

Each game is put in its own directory, with "writeups" collected in this README.

## ctf-shittyaddon

- Game: [ctf-shittyaddon](https://github.com/urish/ctf-shittyaddon)
- Solution: Jupyter workbook to be executed on a Raspberry Pi, talking to the SAO via `I2C`.
    - Actually executed remotely from a host machine.
    - VSCodium just installs and executes a code server on the remote Rpi
    - Could obviously run locally as well
